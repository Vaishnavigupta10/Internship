# Sentiment Analysis NLP Project

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model analyzes text data and classifies it into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset. The notebook uses machine learning models and NLP techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Logistic Regression to classify text data.

### Main Components:
- **Sentiment_Analysis_NLP_Project.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that contains the implementation of sentiment analysis.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model (can be added to the repository).
